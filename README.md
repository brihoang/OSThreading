Our work is usually pair programmed, and commits are from whoever had a computer out.
#Overview

This is a simple operating system for an Operating Systems class. Permission was given to make this open source from the professor. The point of our final project was to implement another feature of an operating system. We chose to implement threading.

#Basic implementation 

We created a new system call called clone which is similar to a fork system call but shares the same virtual memory. This would mean our implementation creates threads through the kernel. This is similar to how Linux implements p_threads. 

#Thanks

Special thanks goes to our professor who asked to be not named.
